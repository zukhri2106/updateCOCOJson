# updateCocoJson
## Introduction
updateCocoJson is a continuation of my previous repository ([Predict-and-Save](https://github.com/zukhri2106/Predict-and-Save.git)). In Predict-and-Save the annotations generated by the prediction are stored in json file as well as txt files. The format used in json file to store the annotations is equal to the COCO Dataset format. Whereas the txt files stores the annotations in YOLO format. Json file that generated can be worked with some image labeling tools such as [coco-Annotator](https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator.git). On the other hand, tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) can be used to modify annotations that were stored in YOLO format. updateCocoJson enables the user to update the json file with the corrected annotations that were made in txt files.
